# Fiabilipy

Port to python 3 by [crubier](http://crubier.net)

## Overview

**fiabilipy** is a python package providing some functions to learn engineering
reliability at university. With this package, one can build easily some
components, put them together to build a complete system and finally evaluate
some metrics (reliability, maintainability, Mean-Time-To-Failure, and so on).

**fiabilipy** also provides tools to describe a system by a Markov process and
evaluating the probability of being in a given state.
