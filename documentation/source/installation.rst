**fiabilipy** is in the `Python Package Index
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fiabilipy/>`_, so it should be quite easy to
install it. Multiple solutions are offered to you.

The main dependencies of fiabilipy are `numpy and scipy
<http://www.scipy.org/install.html>`_ and should be installed before.

Installing on Archlinux
-----------------------

If you are using the `Archlinux <https://www.archlinux.org/>`_ GNU/Linux
distribution, an AUR package has been made. You can find it `here

this package, is that it gets upgraded whenever a new version is available and
you donâ€™t have to manage dependencies.
